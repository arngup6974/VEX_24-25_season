This repository documents my work during the 2024–2025 VEX Robotics season, where I served as the coding lead on a competitive robotics team. It contains our team’s engineering notebook and the robot control code that I led the design and implementation of.

The goal of this repository is to present our engineering process, design reasoning, and system-level integration of mechanical design, control logic, and match strategy under competition constraints.

Engineering Objectives

The primary engineering objectives for the season were to:
Develop reliable autonomous routines capable of consistent performance
Optimize driver control behavior for responsiveness and repeatability
Design a modular codebase that supported rapid iteration during the competition season

Engineering Notebook

The engineering notebook documents the full design lifecycle, including:
Early brainstorming and concept development
Design sketches and mechanical iteration history
A timeline of design changes with technical justification
Trade-off analysis between competing design options
Design decisions driven by game rules and competition constraints
The notebook emphasizes process, iteration, and reasoning rather than final results alone.

Software Architecture

As coding lead, I led the design and implementation of:
Modular drive and control subsystems
Autonomous routines incorporating sensor-based decision logic
Driver-control optimizations to improve consistency during match play
Key design principles included:
Clear separation between hardware abstraction and control logic
Reusability across autonomous routines
Rapid debugging and iteration under time constraints

Testing and Iteration

Testing and refinement were conducted through:
Practice match simulations
Autonomous consistency trials
Driver feedback-driven tuning
Performance was evaluated based on:
Autonomous completion rate
Control responsiveness and stability
Reliability under match-pressure conditions

Competition Results

Regional VEX Think Award
Top 16 placement at the VEX State Championship
Participation at the TSA State Conference
