This repository documents my work throughout the 2024–2025 VEX Robotics season. It includes both my team’s engineering notebook and the code that I led the design and implementation of.

The engineering notebook captures our iterative engineering process, including build changes, brainstorming and early concept development, initial design sketches, coding revisions, project timelines, awards,
detailed explanations of key mechanical systems, and key driving strategies implemented in real competition.

In addition, the repository highlights our competitive outcomes, including awards earned at the regional level and our participation at both the VEX State Championship and TSA State Conference.
